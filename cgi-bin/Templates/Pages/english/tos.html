                  <h3 class="text-indigo-300">15. General Terms</h3>
                  <p>(a) These Terms, as amended from time to time, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements between you and us and may not be modified without our written consent.</p>
                  <p>(b) Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid and unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing herein is intended, nor will be deemed, to confer rights or remedies upon any third party.</p>
                  <p>(e) These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you except with our prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction.</p>
                  <p>(f) You agree that we may provide you with notices by e-mail, regular mail, or postings to the Website.</p>
